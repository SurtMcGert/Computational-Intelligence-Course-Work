# Computational Intelligence Group Course Work

We are training a neural network on the CIFAR10 dataset in an attempt to develop an optimization algorithm that will be
applied to our neural network to optimize the final layer of our network.

## Method

1. develop a neural network
2. train said network on the CIFAR10 dataset using a standard approach such as gradient descent
3. freeze all network layers except the last
4. randomize the weighting of the last layer to removed the previous training
5. re-train the last layer using our optimization algorithm
6. record results
